# README: 
## 🚀 Overview

This project is an AI-powered Medical Chatbot that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with FAISS and OpenAI GPT-4o to provide reliable and contextually accurate medical responses. The chatbot leverages FastAPI as its backend framework to process user queries and retrieve relevant medical information stored in a FAISS vector database. Using LangChain, the chatbot integrates OpenAI's GPT model with vector retrieval, ensuring that responses are relevant and backed by stored medical documents.

## Core Capabilities:

📖 Retrieves Medical Information from Indexed PDFs → Ensures responses are grounded in evidence-based resources.

🤖 AI-Powered Medical Q&A → Uses OpenAI’s gpt-4o for natural language understanding and response generation.

⚕️ Drug Interaction & Dosage Checks → Capable of identifying medication safety concerns and treatment guidelines.

🏥 Local Medical Guidelines Integration → Can be expanded to provide location-based healthcare information.

This project is ideal for medical professionals, researchers, and individuals seeking AI-assisted medical advice based on verified sources.

## Preventing AI Hallucination with RAG

Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), this chatbot localizes responses by retrieving information from a verified medical knowledge base, reducing the likelihood of AI hallucination (i.e., generating incorrect or fabricated information).

This example demonstrates AI hallucination in responses generated by GPT-4o, which produced misleading medical advice. However, when using our trained chatbot, the system retrieved data from FAISS-stored medical sources, ensuring accurate, factual, and context-aware responses. This structured approach makes the chatbot more reliable for healthcare-related queries by grounding the AI in evidence-based data.
